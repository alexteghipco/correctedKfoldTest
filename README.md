# correctedKfoldTest
It is well documented that t-tests have a high type 1 error and low replicability when comparing model performance across repeated k-fold cross-validation.
Various proposals have tired to correct t-tests for type 1 errors. The corrected repeated k-fold cv test implemented here does this while also improving replicability.
